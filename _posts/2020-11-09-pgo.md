        <P>
Distributed systems are difficult to engineer - they are subject to
subtle communication semantics, complex interleavings, and failure
scenarios that cannot happen within a single system. Tools and
modeling languages, such as PlusCal and TLA+, are available to help
developers and architects give a high-level description of a system,
then perform logic on that system, be that via user-guided formal
proofs or systematic exploration via model checking. A common problem
is that corresponding such models to a practical implementation, a
complex and time-consuming process that can introduce bugs to an
otherwise abstractly correct system, is left up to the developer.

PGo compiles PlusCal formal specifications into Go
implementations. PGo is designed to reduce the developer burden of
implementing a correct distributed system specification, and increases
developers' confidence in the correctness of their implementations.
