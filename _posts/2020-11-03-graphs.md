        <h5>Smooth Kronecker Generator</h5>
        <P>As there are a dearth of truly large, publicly available data sets, synthetic graph generators are critical for evaluating the scalability of graph processing systems. We introduced the Smooth Kronecker generator, which produces Kronecker graphs whose fundamental graph characteristics, such as degree distribution, better reflect real world data.</P>
