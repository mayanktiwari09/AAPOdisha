	<P>
  Emerging datacenter applications, such as distributed Machine Learning
training, rely on predictable networking to achieve high
performance. Therefore, cloud providers should efficiently multiplex
datacenter network bandwidth, in addition to compute, memory and other
datacenter resources, across multiple applications. We develop
heuristic and constraint-solver based algorithms to handle datacenter
network bandwidth allocation.
  </P>
  <p>
  Resource allocation has two main objectives: high datacenter
utilization and low-latency decision making. We design algorithms that
provide high datacenter utilization with practical resource allocation
latency. We prototype our solution with OpenStack to
evaluate the practicality of our approach.
