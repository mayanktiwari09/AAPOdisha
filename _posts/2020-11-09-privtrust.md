We often think of privacy like secrecy. We want to keep our
information safe and out of the eyes of others. But privacy is just as
much about trust: who do we want to share our information with and
why? This project looks at the emotional and social dynamics of
privacy and trust in intimate relationships, when people want to give
each other access to sensitive information, and inspects the social
norms and expectations that enable intimate trusting relationships
between parents, friends, children, and partners in a digital realm.

Our group has previously considered several other aspects of this
topic in the context of social insider attacks. In Vulnerability &
Blame: Making Sense of Unauthorized Access to Smartphones (CHI’19),
and Characterizing Social Insider Attacks on Facebook (CHI’17), we
examined stories from people whose partners and friends violated their
trust and accessed their phones and applications without
permission. We found that people wanted to be vulnerable within their
intimate relationships as a way to build trust, but that such trust
was seriously and commonly abused—often with severe consequences. Now,
we are extending that work to see how people with intersecting
identities (e.g., sexuality, age, cultural background) navigate the
conflicting value systems of their different worlds when sharing their
digital lives.
