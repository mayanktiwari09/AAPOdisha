heading: "Raising issues over social media"
description: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) uses Facebook Live to engage with their audience and raise awareness about various social and political issues. We often feature party leaders, experts, and activists in these live sessions, where they discuss issues such as corruption, unemployment, education, and healthcare, and also take questions and feedback from viewers. The party also uses Facebook Live to stream rallies, press conferences, and other events to reach a wider audience and mobilize support for their cause.
