	Formal specification languages such as TLA+ and unity are used to design and verify concurrent programs. These languages are intended for analysis rather than for execution. A compiler or a human must implement the specified program in a lower-level executable language. We present Shellac, a synthesized compiler from unity to Arduino C++ and Verilog. The approach is essentially syntax-directed translation, where the translation rules are automatically generated via program synthesis. This approach produces a correct-by-construction compiler without burdening the compiler writer with manual specification and verification. We evaluate Shellac by compiling Paxos consensus in unity to implementations in Arduino C++ for microcontrollers and Verilog for reconfigurable hardware.
