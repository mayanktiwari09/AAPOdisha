        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <P>Commodity general-purpose operating systems provide rich features but are not suitable for tiny IoT devices that have limited energy and computing resources. Tinkertoy is a framework that allows developers to build their own special-purpose operating systems for IoT. It provides a collection of standard, widely available OS components. Individual components interact with each other through a carefully specified interface so that developers can assemble an operating system carefully designed to suit applicatoin needs.</P>
