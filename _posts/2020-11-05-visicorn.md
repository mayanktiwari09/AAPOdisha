        <h5>Visicorn</h5>
        <P>Visicorn is a visualization system that aids in developing inferences about the anomalies triggered by the Unicorn Intrusion Detection System. By encoding vast, graph-structured data in easy-to-understand visualizations, Visicorn assists IT administrators and security analysts in the identification and root-cause analysis of intrusions within their systems. We transform large graphs, graph histograms, and histogram sketches into highly compressed visual representations that highlight when attacks occur in a system, what sorts of unique events or patterns of events co-occur with those attacks, and what later actions appear to be related to a system anomaly or intrusion. Our goal is to connect intrusions to the parts of the operating system that were vulnerable to the attack.</P>
